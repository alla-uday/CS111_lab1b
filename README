The following README file contains information about each of the following
submissions:
1)client.c
2)server.c
3)Makefile
4)my.key
====================================================================================
client.c and server.c
====================================================================================
1)client makes a TCP socket connection to server provided portnumber through args.
2)client supports --log=<file> option
3)client and server support --encryption option
4)Used the "twofish" encryption algorith in "cfb" mode.
5)Used the tutorial provided in the spec to implement the socket.
6)Both the client and server have two threads each to read and write.

====================================================================================
Makefile
====================================================================================
A simple makefile that has the following targets:
1)default- simply compiles client and server with options -pthread and -lmcrypt
  so as to allow threading and access of libmcrypt.
2)client-compiles the client only
3)server-compiles the server only
4)clean- deletes all (intermediary files)
  buffer files, .o files and executables created.
5)dist- to tar the makefile, readme, my.key, client.c, server.c in a tarball

====================================================================================
my.key
====================================================================================
contains the key for the encryption and decryption options.
